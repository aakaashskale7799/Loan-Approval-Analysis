### Project Overview

 Bank account holders data to work on. As it is rightly said data is a gold mine to extract meaningful information using various tools and techniques.
This project is a good example to work on bank data. 


### Learnings from the project

 Various techniques like Data wrangling, how to interpret the data and get additional information from it.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used customers' income, whether he/she is employed or not. Current loan status and for how many years.
from this, we can make out if a person is capable of having a new loan and completing the existing one.


### Challenges faced

 I think I need to work on my presentation which I was able to learn from greyatom.com


### Additional pointers

 Greyatom helped me to complete one more project
